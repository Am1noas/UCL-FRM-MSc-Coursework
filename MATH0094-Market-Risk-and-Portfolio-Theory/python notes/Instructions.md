# First assignment
## Market Risk and Portfolio Theory


The purpose of this assignment is to provide further exercises to practice Python in the context of the module. It also aims to serve as preparation for the first exam.


## Description

This assignment is formative, and so it does not impact your mark. If you are up to date in following the Python notebooks, my advice is that you give yourself initially a fixed time frame to solve this assignment (for example 2.5 hours). Then account how much time and help in addition you required. Make note of all parts that required a big time investment to look for. This can help you prepare for the exam.


## Instructions


### General
- The assignment has to be completely done in the CoCalc folder Assignment 1. Apart from this you only require pen and paper. 
- You can use all the material in the course as well as the Python documentation available online. 
- Everything you submit must be your own work.
- Avoid posting questions on how to solve the assignment on Moodle before the deadline. Only questions about clarifying the subject are acceptable (we will have a special thread). After the deadline, the discussion on the subject is encouraged both in the forum and in the Q&A sessions.
- You must not post questions on online forums or receive any other form of direct external help. 

### On the code

- Make sure that every function your write returns errors when the parameters are not of the type or value expected.
- To help you improve your code, I have included some validation tests. You can run them at any time by clicking on the 'validate' button in the tool bar of the notebook.
- Explain your code using both comments and Markdown cells as needed.


## Deadline

- CoCalc will retrieve your work by **Friday 13th November at 10:00am London time**. 
- To avoid any technical problem, I encourage you to download and save the Python notebook with your answers. In this way, should any technical problem arise, I can ask you to submit it in another way.
